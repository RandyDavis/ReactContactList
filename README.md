Repo for React Contact List project.

Made with:
- NodeJS and React (Create React App)
- HTML, CSS, React-Bootstrap, RandomUser API

Notes:
- RandomUser API does not return unique id for each user so the key attribute may sometimes duplicate on occassion
- V2 will implement ability to make contacts into an array and then add a new contact to the list
